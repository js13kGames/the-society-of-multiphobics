# Welcome to the Society of Multiphobics
In this puzzle game you have the role of an Event Planner for the dinner of the Society of Multiphobics. 

Your task is to assign all the guests to chairs at the tables in such a way that no phobia is triggered.

## Info & Controls
All the information is displayed within the game, but here are some backup infos just in case:
- the guests are represented by emojis
- the phobias of each emoji are represented below the emoji (again with emojis) 
- select the emoji to get a larger preview and more information about the phobias
- change the position by using drag and drop or clicking an empty chair
- you can also use the empty fields as intermediate storage
- the game is won when all guests are seated correctly


- note: some guests are represented by object emojis, treat them as persons nevertheless, we don't want to discriminate anyone :)

## Stats & Fun Facts
- this is my 4th time participating
- I worked ~80 hours on this game (longest time so far), but I had a lot of fun 😁
- My husband supported me an additional ~10 hours (DevOps + the drag&drop feature)
- 10% of the coding happened on a plane over the Atlantic Ocean ✈️ and another ~30% while travelling the US 🇺🇸 
- I spent around 4 hours on the music using SoundBox. I used the only song I know how to play on the piano 🎹 and added some drums and bass
- I did around 10 iterations with Poki playtests, which gave me some good insights, especially to improve the tutorial
- I like emojis 🙃

## Nest steps if I had more time and space
- improve scoring system
- additional modes, e.g. time-based or gambling
- add custom svgs
- add sounds
